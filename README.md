# DRIFT Car Showcase Demo
A car showcase for Nintendo 64 using libdragon sdk + Tiny3D. Eventually I'd like to turn this into a complete drifting/racing game. Download the .z64 rom and run it on an emulator (like Ares or Gopher64) or flash cart with original hardware. 3D models created with Blender + Fast64.
